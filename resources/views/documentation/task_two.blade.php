    <h2>Project Description in brief</h2>
    <p>
        I have completed all the requirements that listed the assignment sheet, including <strong>navigation bar, ERD, database implementation, list, product review pages etc</strong>.
    </p>

        At the beginning of the project deployment, I drew a rough UI design in order to give a idea myself that how was the website looked like. 
        It was just a rough idea. The final website didn't 100% match due to lack of techical skills like ajax, Javascript etc, but I have tried to 
        make all the effort to do the assignment. 
    </p>

        In term of dealing with the backend, I have used the methods that learned from lecture videos, which are really useful for me to watch it again and again. I have been using DB Class in <strong>ProductController</strong> to organise data
        from database to frontend and from the frontend to the backend.
