    <h2>Project Description in brief</h2>
    <p>
        I have completed all the requirements that listed the assignment sheet, including <strong>navigation bar, ERD, database implementation, list, product review pages etc</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Laravel Eloquent are used for all tasks in this assignemnt. This is a big project that is needed to be done in less than a month, which is a challenge for me. However, due to my diligence, I have successfully completed all compulsory requirements. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Access control is done as per requirement. The administrator has the highest access right for review and product CRUD while regular users can add, edit and delete their own reviews.
    </p>
